title: Submit your app
---

Okta has updated the process by which an independent software vendor (ISV) publishes their integration into the Okta Integration Network (OIN).

When you are ready, use [the OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com/) tool to submit for Okta review.

In order for an app to be published in the Okta Integration Network, you'll need the following:

* A configuration guide explaining:
  * Supported features
  * Step-by-step instructions for setting up the integration
  * Known issues and troubleshooting suggestions
  * Customer support contact information
* Development support contact information
* Escalation contact information
* Full, permanent test tenant provided to Okta
* RunScope test suite results

Okta analysts review the submission, create the customized app, and run it through Okta internal quality assurance testing. If any changes are required in your app, the analysts will request the change and you will need to resubmit the app with the updates.

Once Okta completes all internal QA processes and confirms that any requested changes are complete, the analysts publish the Okta-Verified app to the Okta Integration Network.
