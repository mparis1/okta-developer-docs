title: Run through OIN QA tests

## Test your end to end app integration

After your SCIM integration has passed all the Runscope tests and you have your customer guide ready, you can now run through the OIN quality assurance test cases in this spreadsheet.

* [Okta SCIM Test Plan](/standards/SCIM/SCIMFiles/okta-scim-test-plan.xlsx)

When you have completed all the testing, you can [submit your app to the OIN](/docs/guides/submit-app/).
